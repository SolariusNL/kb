Infra allows you to create new user accounts on your Linux machines managed by Infra. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new user account.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- An Infra instance with at least one server
- Administrative access to Infra and the server you want to create a user account on

## Create a new user account

1. Navigate to the server you want to create a user account on.
2. In the sidebar, click on the "Accounts" tab.
3. Click on the blue "Create new account" button.
4. Fill in the form with the following information:
   - **Full name**: The full name of the user, e.g. "John Doe"
   - **User name**: The username for the new account, e.g. "johndoe"
   - **Home directory**: The location of the user's home directory, e.g. "/home/johndoe". This field is optional, and if left blank, Infra will automatically generate a home directory for the user.
   - **Shell**: The user's default shell, e.g. "/bin/bash"
   - **User ID**: The user's unique identifier, e.g. "1001". This field is optional, and if left blank, Infra will automatically generate a user ID for the user.
   - **Authentication**: The user's authentication method.
   - **Password**: The user's password.
   - **Confirm password**: Confirm the user's password for accuracy.

And that's it! You've successfully created a new user account through Infra. You can now log in to the server using the new user account.
