Postmortems are a critical part of incident management. They help teams learn from past incidents and prevent them from happening again. In Status, you can publish a postmortem to share with your team.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a Status account subscribed to the Business plan to publish a postmortem. The Business plan starts at $1.99 per user per month.

## Steps

1. Open the Status app and sign in to your account.
2. Go to your incident dashboard.
3. Click on the incident for which you want to publish a postmortem.
4. Click on the **Postmortem** tab.
5. Click on the **Create Postmortem** button.
6. Fill in the details of the postmortem, such as the title, description, and root cause analysis.
7. Click on the **Publish** button to publish the postmortem.

That's it! You have successfully published a postmortem in Status. Your team can now access the postmortem and learn from the incident.

## API reference
